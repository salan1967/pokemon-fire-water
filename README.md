# pokemon-fire-water
In this mini data visualization project, I was tasked with recreating a plots using R and ggplot2. 
First I created a scatter plot that showed the relationship between Pokémon Height and Special Attack, using color to differentiate between Evolutionary Stages. I customized the color scheme and saved the plot as a PNG file. Then, I created a bar plot to visualize the number of Pokémon in each Evolutionary Stage, grouped by Pokémon Type (e.g., "Water", "Fire").
The plot needed to use facet_wrap() to separate the data by evolutionary stage and be saved as a high-resolution PNG file. Additionally, I had to ensure proper data filtering by removing missing values and correctly referencing column names in the csv file.
